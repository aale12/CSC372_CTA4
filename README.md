## Option 1: Creating an abstract class
This application is consists of an abstract class, three classes that inherit from it, and a driver class
- The Shape abstract class has methods for calculating surface area and volume
- Each shape (cylinder, cone, sphere) overrides the abstract class' methods for surface area and volume with their own
- The driver class creates one of each shape, places them in an array and prints their calculated surface area and  volume to the user.
